# Redocly API developer portal

## Prerequisites
### 1. install node.js and check the version
    
[node.js >= 12.22.6 and <= 16.x](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    node -v


### 2. make sure that npm is installed 

    npm -v


### 3. install yarn 

    npm install --location=global yarn


## Install

    yarn install

## Start development server

    yarn start

Note: search isn't functional in the development environment.

## Troubleshooting

We heavily rely on caching for performance issues so if some changes are not reflected in the resulting portal try cleaning cache by running:

    yarn clean

## Docs

Read the [online documentation](https://redoc.ly/docs/developer-portal/introduction/).

## Training program

The starter template contains training exercises which will teach you how to build a developer portal.
After you start the development server, navigate to the app and follow the instructions to get started with your training.
